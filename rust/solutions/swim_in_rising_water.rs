 * Testcase Example:  '[[0,2],[1,3]]'
 *
 * You are given an n x n integer matrix grid where each value grid[i][j]
 * represents the elevation at that point (i, j).
 *
 * It starts raining, and water gradually rises over time. At time t, the water
 * level is t, meaning any cell with elevation less than equal to t is
 * submerged or reachable.
 *
 * You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and
 * only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most t. You can
 * swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the
 * boundaries of the grid during your swim.
 *
 * Return the minimum time until you can reach the bottom right square (n - 1,
 * n - 1) if you start at the top left square (0, 0).
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).
 * You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have
 * a higher elevation than t = 0.
 * You cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.
 * When the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: grid =
 * [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
 * Output: 16
 * Explanation: The final route is shown.
 * We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * n == grid.length
 * n == grid[i].length
 * 1 <= n <= 50
 * 0 <= grid[i][j] <Â n^2
 * Each value grid[i][j] is unique.
