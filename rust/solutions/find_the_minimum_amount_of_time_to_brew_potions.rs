 * Testcase Example:  '[1,5,2,4]\n[5,1,4,2]'
 *
 * You are given two integer arrays, skill and mana, of length n and m,
 * respectively.
 *
 * In a laboratory, n wizards must brew m potions in order. Each potion has a
 * mana capacity mana[j] and must pass through all the wizards sequentially to
 * be brewed properly. The time taken by the i^th wizard on the j^th potion is
 * timeij = skill[i] * mana[j].
 *
 * Since the brewing process is delicate, a potion must be passed to the next
 * wizard immediately after the current wizard completes their work. This means
 * the timing must be synchronized so that each wizard begins working on a
 * potion exactly when it arrives. â€‹
 *
 * Return the minimum amount of time required for the potions to be brewed
 * properly.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: skill = [1,5,2,4], mana = [5,1,4,2]
 *
 * Output: 110
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Potion Number
 * Start time
 * Wizard 0 done by
 * Wizard 1 done by
 * Wizard 2 done by
 * Wizard 3 done by
 *
 *
 * 0
 * 0
 * 5
 * 30
 * 40
 * 60
 *
 *
 * 1
 * 52
 * 53
 * 58
 * 60
 * 64
 *
 *
 * 2
 * 54
 * 58
 * 78
 * 86
 * 102
 *
 *
 * 3
 * 86
 * 88
 * 98
 * 102
 * 110
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * As an example for why wizard 0 cannot start working on the 1^st potion
 * before time t = 52, consider the case where the wizards started preparing
 * the 1^st potion at time t = 50. At time t = 58, wizard 2 is done with the
 * 1^st potion, but wizard 3 will still be working on the 0^th potion till time
 * t = 60.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: skill = [1,1,1], mana = [1,1,1]
 *
 * Output: 5
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * Preparation of the 0^th potion begins at time t = 0, and is completed by
 * time t = 3.
 * Preparation of the 1^st potion begins at time t = 1, and is completed by
 * time t = 4.
 * Preparation of the 2^nd potion begins at time t = 2, and is completed by
 * time t = 5.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: skill = [1,2,3,4], mana = [1,2]
 *
 * Output: 21
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * n == skill.length
 * m == mana.length
 * 1 <= n, m <= 5000
 * 1 <= mana[i], skill[i] <= 5000
 *
